## Mini apps with login

- Generic BE Service that saves json(some key-value store where key=app+user and value=json; value=app for non user specific dynamic data)
- FE Service that has login page(same for all FE Services)
- FE Service that is a app that has its whole state in a json that gets synced with BE(Kanbanboard, Scrumboard, notes, calendar etc)
